Tips:

* By dragging a folder to "start.bat", that folder will be shared.
  - That means changes to files inside will be reflected at server side.

* By dragging a file, or many items, they will be copied to a temporary folder and shared.
  - That means changes to original files will not be reflected at server side.

* You can configure PHFS at ./phfs/hfs.ini.
  - Configuration includes port, accounts, base path, and so on.
